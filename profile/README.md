# Alliander open source
Alliander stands for high-quality knowledge of energy networks, energy technology and technical innovation. To support Alliander's digitalization, we use open source and contribute to open source projects.

Visit https://www.alliander.com/en/open-source/ to learn more about open source at Alliander!

## Get involved
If you want to get involved, please have a look around in this Github organization. In the "Pinned" section you'll find Alliander's featured open source projects (e.g. [Weather Provider API](https://github.com/alliander-opensource/Weather-Provider-API)). You'll also find projects containing upstream contributions to other open source projects, and projects that are not (yet) open source but open to the public.

Check out https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/ for the open source projects that we develop in collaboration with LF Energy (e.g. [Power Grid Model](https://github.com/PowerGridModel), [OpenSTEF](https://github.com/OpenSTEF), [CoMPAS](https://github.com/com-pas), [OpenSCD](https://github.com/openscd), [OperatorFabric](https://github.com/opfab), [Shapeshifter](https://github.com/shapeshifter), and [Grid eXchange Fabric](https://github.com/OSGP/open-smart-grid-platform)).
