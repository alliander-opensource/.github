## Get Involved
If you're looking to get involved, please have a look around in this github organization. In the "Pinned" section you will find Alliander's featured open source projects (e.g. [Power Grid Model](https://github.com/alliander-opensource/power-grid-model), [Weather Provider API](https://github.com/alliander-opensource/Weather-Provider-API)). Furthermore, you can find projects that contain upstream contributions to other open source projects and projects that are not perse open source but open to the public. 

And also have a look at https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/ for the open source projects that we develop in collaboration with LF Energy (e.g. [OpenSTEF](https://github.com/OpenSTEF/openstef), [CoMPAS](https://github.com/com-pas), [OperatorFabric](https://github.com/opfab), [Shapeshift](https://github.com/shapeshifter)).
